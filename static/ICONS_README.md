# PWA Icons

This directory needs the following icon files for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Files

1. **favicon.png** (32x32 or 48x48)
   - Standard favicon for browsers

2. **icon-192.png** (192x192)
   - Used on Android home screens
   - Should be a square image with your app logo/icon

3. **icon-512.png** (512x512)
   - Used for splash screens and high-res displays
   - Should be a square image with your app logo/icon

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use an Icon Generator
- Visit [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Upload your logo/design
- Download the generated icons
- Place them in this directory

### Option 2: Create Manually
- Design a square logo (512x512px minimum)
- Use an image editor to create the different sizes:
  - 192x192px → save as icon-192.png
  - 512x512px → save as icon-512.png
  - 48x48px → save as favicon.png

### Option 3: Use a Simple Placeholder
For testing, you can create simple colored squares using any image editor or online tool.

## Tips
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Make sure the icon works on both light and dark backgrounds
- Test how it looks when installed on a mobile device
- Keep the design centered with some padding around the edges
